# Thaumcraft 7 (Thavma)

## Preface

A complete rewrite & re-imagination of azanor's Thaumcraft for modern versions of Minecraft.
I am in no way associated with azanor and will not use any of their assets,
except perhaps temporarily the mod name (which I will also change upon release).

What version of Thaumcraft am I rewriting? None specifically. I am going to implement what
I enjoyed most from each version (my favorite being Thaumcraft 4.2). I plan to add
features that did not exist in the original mod, and change old features to give them
fresh new mechanics, visuals and names.

I happen to be Greek, Thaumaturgy literally means "the act of performing miracles".
Good pick azanor ;-)
